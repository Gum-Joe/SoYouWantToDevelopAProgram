In this repo, we'll guide you through getting the ideas for the program, all the way to publishing.\r\n\r\n# Contents\r\n* <a href=\"#user-content-getting-started\">Getting started</a>\r\n  * <a href=\"#user-content-getting-an-idea\">Getting an idea</a>\r\n  * What language?\r\n  * Open source?\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n### Getting an idea\r\nEvery program that was every developed either:\r\n\r\n<b>A:</b> Solved a problem\r\n\r\n<b>B:</b> Made something easier to do\r\n\r\n<b>C:</b> Developed on another's ideas\r\n\r\nHere are some examples (most are taken from the front page of the projects website):\r\n\r\n| Program        | Problem/Idea |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:|\r\n| Github      | People need a place for source code where they can easily contribute to the code & easily flag up issues |\r\n| Rails     | We need a way to make developing modern web-apps fun and easy  |\r\n| Docker      | Developers should be able to ship, pack and run applications in a lightweight form |\r\n| Vagrant      | Make portable development environments easier to create and configure |\r\n\r\n#### So what about me?\r\nHere's how we recommend going about getting your idea:\r\n\r\n1. Think about what really is time-consuming, annoys you or could be easier to do (i.e I spend 30 minutes build a docker image only to find that I forgot to not use the parent directory (`..`) in a `COPY` instruction.\r\n\r\n2. Get creative: think about how the problem could be solved, for example, linting the Dockerfile before the build.\r\n\r\n#### Tips (add any if you want)\r\n* Go for something that fits your ability. If you have just started programming, go for a small project, such as a cli app.\r\n* Keep it simple (<a href=\"./simplicity.md\">how do I class an idea's simplicity?</a>). Ideas that are simple tend to be able to be developed more quickly.\r\n* If going for a large ideas (e.g. I need a ui), consider getting together some people, that you can work well with, together.\r\n\r\n## What language?\r\n<b>Coming soon</b>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

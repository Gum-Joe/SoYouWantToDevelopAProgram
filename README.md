# So you want to develop program?
So you want to develop a program? Well, you've come to the right place. In this repo, we'll guide you through getting the ideas for the program, all the way to publishing.

# Getting started
### Getting an idea
Every program that was every developed either:

<b>A:</b> Solved a problem

<b>B:</b> Made something easier to do

<b>C:</b> Developed on another's ideas

Here are some examples (most are taken from the front page of the projects website):

| Program        | Problem/Idea |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Github      | People need a place for source code where they can easily contribute to the code & easily flag up issues |
| Rails     | We need a way to make developing modern web-apps fun and easy  |
| Docker      | Developers should be able to ship, pack and run applications in a lightweight form |
| Vagrant      | Make portable development environments easier to create and configure |

#### So what about me?
Here's how we recommend going about getting your idea:

1. Think about what really is time-consuming, annoys you or could be easier to do (i.e I spend 30 minutes build a docker image only to find that I forgot to not use the parent directory (`..`) in a `COPY` instruction.

2. Get creative: think about how the problem could be solved, for example, linting the Dockerfile before the build.

#### Tips (add any if you want)
* Go for something that fits your ability. If you have just started programming, go for a small project, such as a cli app.
* Keep it simple (<a href="./simplicity.md">how do I class an idea's simplicity?</a>). Ideas that are simple tend to be able to be developed more quickly.
* If going for a large ideas (e.g. I need a ui), consider getting together some people, that you can work well with, together.
